# Priority Queue and its Application

##Motivation 

This project will give you experience in implementing priority queues using C++. You will also empirically study the efficiency of different implementations. 

##Project Overview 

In this project, you are given a rectangular grid of cells. Each cell has a number indicating its weight, which is the cost of passing through the cell (In Fig.1, the color of the cell symbolizes its weight). You can assume the weights are positive integers. The input will give you the starting coordinate and the ending coordinate. As figure 1 shows, your task is to use priority queue to find the shortest path from the source cell to the ending cell.

## Input

 You will read from the standard input. (For the ease of testing, you can write each test case in 

a file and then use Linux file redirection function “<” to read from the file.) 

The format of the input is as follows: 

```
<width m>
<height n>
<Start x> <Start y>
<End x> <End y>
<W(0,0)> <W(1,0)> ... <W(m-1,0)>
...
<W(0,n-1)> <W(1,n-1)> ... <W(m-1,n-1)>
```

The first and the second line give the width 𝑚 and the height 𝑛 of the grid, respectively. They are positive integers. The third and the fourth line give the starting coordinate and the ending coordinate, respectively. They are non-negative integers within the valid range. The upper left corner has the coordinate (0, 0). The x-coordinate increases from left to right and the y-coordinate increases from top to bottom. The remaining lines give the weights of the cells in the grid. They represent a two dimensional array of 𝑛 rows and 𝑚 columns, as shown above. 𝑊(𝑖,𝑗) is the weight of the cell at coordinate (𝑖,𝑗) (0 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑚 − 1,0 ≤ 𝑗 ≤ 𝑛 − 1). The weights are all positive integers. 

For example, we have an input: 

```ruby
4
4
00
33 
5123 
2156 
4111
3605
```

It specifies a grid of width 4 and height 4. We want to find the shortest path form point (0, 0), which has weight 5, to the point (3, 3), which has weight 5.

## Algorithm

Below is the pseudo-code of the algorithm:

```perl
Let PQ be a priority queue;
start_point.pathcost = start_point.cellweight;
Mark start_point as reached;
PQ.enqueue(start_point);
while(PQ is not empty) {
    C = PQ.dequeueMin(); // The key is cell’s pathcost
    for each neighbor N of C that has not been reached {
        N.pathcost = C.pathcost + N.cellweight;
        mark cell N as reached;
        mark the predecessor of N as C;
        // I.e., N is reached from C.
        if(end_point == N) {
            trace_back_path(); // Trace and print the path
                                // through predecessor info
			return; 
		}        
		else PQ.enqueue(N);
    }
}

```



## Command Line Input 

Your program should be named main. It should take the following case-sensitive command-line options: 

1. -i, --implementation: a required option. It changes the priority queue implementation at runtime. An argument should immediately follow that option, being BINARY, UNSORTED, or FIBONACCI to indicate the implementation (see Section VII Implementations of Priority Queues). 
2. -v, --verbose: an optional flag that indicates the program should print additional outputs (see Section VI Output). 

Examples of legal command lines: 

-  ./main --implementation BINARY < infile.txt

- ./main --verbose -i UNSORTED < infile.txt > outfile.txt 

- ./main --verbose -i FIBONACCI 

Note that the first two calls read the input stored in the infile.txt. The third call reads from the standard input. 

Examples of illegal command lines: 

- ./main < infile.txt
   No implementation is specified. Implementation is a required option. 

-  ./main --implementation BINARY infile.txt 

You are not using input redirection “<” to read from the file infile.txt. 

We require you to realize the above requirement using the function **getopt_long**. See its usage and an example at http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Getopt.html#Getopt 

In testing your program, we will supply correct command-line inputs, but you are encouraged to detect and handle errors in the command-line inputs.
