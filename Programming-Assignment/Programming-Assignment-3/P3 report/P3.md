# Priority Queue and its Application

##Motivation 

This project will give you experience in implementing priority queues using C++. You will also empirically study the efficiency of different implementations. 

##Project Overview 

In this project, you are given a rectangular grid of cells. Each cell has a number indicating its weight, which is the cost of passing through the cell (In Fig.1, the color of the cell symbolizes its weight). You can assume the weights are positive integers. The input will give you the starting coordinate and the ending coordinate. As figure 1 shows, your task is to use priority queue to find the shortest path from the source cell to the ending cell. 

<div align=center><img width = '150' height ='150' src ="https://ws2.sinaimg.cn/large/006tNbRwgy1fwsi3w8p4fj30h00i8glk.jpg" alt=”Figure 1”/></div>

## Input

 You will read from the standard input. (For the ease of testing, you can write each test case in 

a file and then use Linux file redirection function “<” to read from the file.) 

The format of the input is as follows: 

```
<width m>
<height n>
<Start x> <Start y>
<End x> <End y>
<W(0,0)> <W(1,0)> ... <W(m-1,0)>
...
<W(0,n-1)> <W(1,n-1)> ... <W(m-1,n-1)>
```

The first and the second line give the width 𝑚 and the height 𝑛 of the grid, respectively. They are positive integers. The third and the fourth line give the starting coordinate and the ending coordinate, respectively. They are non-negative integers within the valid range. The upper left corner has the coordinate (0, 0). The x-coordinate increases from left to right and the y-coordinate increases from top to bottom. The remaining lines give the weights of the cells in the grid. They represent a two dimensional array of 𝑛 rows and 𝑚 columns, as shown above. 𝑊(𝑖,𝑗) is the weight of the cell at coordinate (𝑖,𝑗) (0 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑚 − 1,0 ≤ 𝑗 ≤ 𝑛 − 1). The weights are all positive integers. 

For example, we have an input: 

```ruby
4
4
00
33 
5123 
2156 
4111
3605
```

It specifies a grid of width 4 and height 4. We want to find the shortest path form point (0, 0), which has weight 5, to the point (3, 3), which has weight 5.

## Algorithm

Below is the pseudo-code of the algorithm:

```perl
Let PQ be a priority queue;
start_point.pathcost = start_point.cellweight;
Mark start_point as reached;
PQ.enqueue(start_point);
while(PQ is not empty) {
    C = PQ.dequeueMin(); // The key is cell’s pathcost
    for each neighbor N of C that has not been reached {
        N.pathcost = C.pathcost + N.cellweight;
        mark cell N as reached;
        mark the predecessor of N as C;
        // I.e., N is reached from C.
        if(end_point == N) {
            trace_back_path(); // Trace and print the path
                                // through predecessor info
			return; 
		}        
		else PQ.enqueue(N);
    }
}

```



## Command Line Input 

Your program should be named main. It should take the following case-sensitive command-line options: 

1. -i, --implementation: a required option. It changes the priority queue implementation at runtime. An argument should immediately follow that option, being BINARY, UNSORTED, or FIBONACCI to indicate the implementation (see Section VII Implementations of Priority Queues). 
2. -v, --verbose: an optional flag that indicates the program should print additional outputs (see Section VI Output). 

Examples of legal command lines: 

-  ./main --implementation BINARY < infile.txt

- ./main --verbose -i UNSORTED < infile.txt > outfile.txt 

- ./main --verbose -i FIBONACCI 

Note that the first two calls read the input stored in the infile.txt. The third call reads from the standard input. 

Examples of illegal command lines: 

- ./main < infile.txt
   No implementation is specified. Implementation is a required option. 

-  ./main --implementation BINARY infile.txt 

You are not using input redirection “<” to read from the file infile.txt. 

We require you to realize the above requirement using the function **getopt_long**. See its usage and an example at http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Getopt.html#Getopt 

In testing your program, we will supply correct command-line inputs, but you are encouraged to detect and handle errors in the command-line inputs. 



## Three Heap Algorithm

### 1. Unsorted heap

Here we can use `std::min_element` and `std::distance` as [here](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/min_element) says. Below is an example.

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
int main(){
    std::vector<int> v{3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9};
    std::vector<int>::iterator result = std::min_element(std::begin(v), std::end(v));
    std::cout << "min element at: " << std::distance(std::begin(v), result);
}
```

### 2. Binary Heap

A small complete binary tree stored in an array is arranged as below as an array.

<div align=center><img height ='50' src ="https://ws3.sinaimg.cn/large/006tNbRwgy1fwxggo3forj30go047gly.jpg"/></div>

According to the courseware, we know:

1. The first element is stored at index 1.

2. A node at index 𝑖 (𝑖 ≠ 1) has its parent at index

3. Assume the number of nodes is 𝑛. A node at index 𝑖 (2𝑖 ≤ 𝑛) has its left child at 2𝑖.
   ​	If 2𝑖 > 𝑛, it has no left child. 

4. A node at index 𝑖 (2𝑖 + 1 ≤ 𝑛) has its right child at 2𝑖 + 1. 

   ​	If 2𝑖 + 1 > 𝑛, it has no right child. 

<div align=center><img height ='150' src ="https://ws3.sinaimg.cn/large/006tNbRwgy1fwxgkkezgaj30mu0dwmz4.jpg"/></div>

To make the first element to be stored at index 1 instead of index 0, we add `data.push_back(TYPE())` at the beginning of the constructor, such that we can make the program much simple and easy to write.

#### caution!

Persucode of `dequeueMin`  is shown as below.

```c++
Item minHeap::dequeueMin() {
  swap(heap[1], heap[size--]);
  percolateDown(1);
  return heap[size+1];
}
```

Here `size--` means we need to decrease `size` by 1 at function `percolateDown`.

### 3. Fibonacci Heap

A [Fibonacci heap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_heap) is a collection of trees satisfying the minimum-heap property, that is, the key of a child is always greater than or equal to the key of the parent. 

<div align=center><img height ='150' src ="https://ws4.sinaimg.cn/large/006tNbRwgy1fwxhuuzki1j30js0h8goe.jpg"/></div>

According to `Pseudo-code for Fibonacci heap` at appendix, we can find that fot Fibonacci heap we need `n, min, degree, key, child, parent`.

> n stores the number of elements in the heap
>
> min refers to the minimal element in the heap

so we can constract this structure as private part.

```c++
	struct node
    {
        TYPE val;
        typename std::list<fib_node> child;
        int degree=0;
    };
    typename std::list<fib_node> parent;
    typename std::list<fib_node>::iterator min;
    int n=0;
    TYPE empty_fib=TYPE();
```
