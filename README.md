## About Honor Code

If there is same questions or labs in the future, it is the responsibility of JI students not to copy or modify these codes, or TeX files because it is against the Honor Code. The owner of this repository dosen't take any commitment for other's faults.

According to the student handbook (2015 version),

> It is a violation of the Honor Code for students to submit, as their own, work that is not the result of their own labor and thoughts. This applies, in particular, to ideas, expressions or work obtained from other students as well as from books, the internet, and other sources. The failure to properly credit ideas, expressions or work from others is considered plagiarism.

Textbook (Recommended but not required): 

1. Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis, by Clifford Shaffer.
   Online available: http://people.cs.vt.edu/~shaffer/Book/C++3e20120605.pdf 
2.  Data Structures and Algorithms with Object-Oriented Design Patterns in C++, by Bruno Preiss.

## Class Webpage: 

Log into Canvas at https://umjicanvas.com. Announcements, lecture slides, assignments, and grades will be posted on the class webpage. 

## Course Prerequisites: 

Ve280 Programming and Elementary Data Structures and Ve203 Discrete Mathematics. 

Grading Policy: 

There will be some quizzes, 6 written assignments, 5 programming assignments, one midterm exam, and one final exam. The grading distribution is: 

In-class quizzes: 5% 

Written assignments: 20% 

Programming assignments: 30% 

Midterm Exam: 20% 

Final Exam: 25% 

Any questions about the grading of the projects or exams must be brought to the attention of your TAs or the instructor within one week after the item is returned. 

## Exam 

The exams will be closed book ones. No electronic devices are allowed in the exams. 

You are expected to take both exams at the scheduled times. If you miss an exam, and a medical or personal emergency is not involved, you will receive a zero for that exam. If you anticipate an exam in another course, you must notify the instructor at least one week before the exam date. 

## Academic Integrity: 

1. All students are expected to attend all of the lectures. You cannot do intern on the lecture days. 
2. All programming assignments must be done by yourself independently. You may discuss the project in oral with other student. However, you may not read/copy others’ solution and you may not use test cases from others. In all cases in which we have reason to believe that cheating has occurred, we will report your case to the Honor Council for evaluation. 
3. Exams will be given under the JI’s Honor Code and will require individual efforts.
